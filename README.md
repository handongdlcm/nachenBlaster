# nachenBlaster

This is a Project from UCLA CS32

This project is an exciting game done using various Data Structures and Algorithms.

To see what the game looks like in action,

macOS: You'll need to have XQuartz and freeGLUT installed to run the program. 

Install XQuartz: Click the download link, open the downloaded .dmg file, double-click on XQuartz.pkg, and follow the installation instructions. Log out and log back in again. To verify the installation, open a Terminal window and run the command echo $DISPLAY. That should produce one line of output that ends with org.macosforge.xquartz:0. 

Install freeGLUT: Install the homebrew package manager. Open a Terminal window and run the command brew install freeglut.

I did this project and run it on Xcode.
